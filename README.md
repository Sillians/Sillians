## Hii there!! 👋👋👋
#### I'm a Data | MLOps Engineer.
I have passion for learning 💛💥 and I like having fun solving Data / Machine Learning related problems. I love reading ML research papers and diversed books 📚 of which my favorites are 
- Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
- Originals by Adam Grant
- Bad Blood (Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup) by John Carreyrou
- Ace of Spades by Faridah Abike-Iyimide
- Atomic Habits by James Clear
- Educated by Tara Westover and 
- A thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins

I am very much open to learning something new 👐, exploring new oppurtunities 😎, contributing/collaborating on ML related projects, open to great conversations as well. In Love with the game of Basketball 🏀 (#Dubnation) and Tennis.
