👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate Data & Machine Learning Engineer who thrives on the excitement of solving complex data and ML-related challenges. An insatiable curiosity and a love for continuous learning fuel my journey.

I’m always eager to learn something new, whether it's a cutting-edge ML technique, a novel approach to data engineering, or an entirely new field. I’m open to exploring new opportunities, collaborating on exciting ML projects, and engaging in thought-provoking conversations.

Outside of the tech world, I'm a huge fan of basketball 🏀 (#Dubnation) and tennis 🎾.
