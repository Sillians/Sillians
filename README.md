## Hey there!! 👋
#### I'm Basil Ihuoma ☺☺.
I have passion for learning 💛💥 and I like having fun solving Machine Learning related problems (Still figuring things out bit by bit). I love reading ML research papers and diversed books 📚 of which my favorites are 
- Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
- Originals by Adam Grant
- Atomic Habits by James Clear
- Educated by Tara Westover and 
- A thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins

I am very much open to learning something new 👐, exploring new oppurtunities 😎, contributing/collaborating on ML related projects, open to great conversations as well.
