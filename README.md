## Painstakingly Overfitting on a Learning Curve.

With a background in data science and extensive Python experience, I'm diving deeper into solving real-world problems using data engineering and machine learning. Every day brings new growth opportunities, and my passion for continuous learning drives me to tackle complex challenges, sharpen my skills, and share valuable insights. I believe in learning by building and building by learning, whether it’s foundational computer science, software engineering practices, or advanced machine learning techniques. 

I enjoy early morning runs and occasionally play basketball.
